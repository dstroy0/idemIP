"""Carry the version out of .bumpversion.cfg and into the source tree, and say when it has drifted.

.bumpversion.cfg is where the current version is stated, and `bump2version` moves it:

    bump2version patch                  0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
    bump2version minor                  0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
    bump2version major                  0.1.0 -> 1.0.0
    bump2version --dry-run --verbose minor        what it would write, and to what

That writes three files, and they are the three that carry a version as data and nothing else:
library.json and library.properties publish it to a package index, and CMakeLists.txt hands it to
project(). Those three were apart once already - both manifests said v0.0.0 while CMake and every
banner in the tree said 0.1.0 - which is the whole reason a version now has one home.

bump2version cannot write the other two forms, so this does:

    the IDEMIP_VERSION_* block in src/idemip_config.h, the only copy a consumer can reach from C.
    Four lines that have to move together, and bump2version 1.0.1 matches a single line at a time.

    the banner at the head of every file in the tree, in whichever comment the file's language
    takes. There are 184 of them and a new file appears whenever a unit does, so they are found by
    walking rather than by being listed.

Neither is a fixed string bump2version can be pointed at, and both go stale silently: a banner
reading v0.1.0 in a 0.2.0 tree is wrong in a way no compiler and no test can see.

    python tools/dev_env/version.py              what would change, and nothing written
    python tools/dev_env/version.py --sync       write it
    python tools/dev_env/version.py --check      exit nonzero when anything has drifted

--check is the CI shape, beside guards.py, counters.py and deadstate.py. Note that .bumpversion.cfg
itself carries no banner and no SPDX line: bump2version rewrites that file through configparser on
every bump, which drops comments, so anything written there survives exactly until the next bump.
This docstring is where that explanation lives instead.
